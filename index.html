        <p>In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal
          amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each
          section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use
          the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the
          desktop mockup illustration below.</p>

          second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view,
